/*
* Per https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme setting the color scheme
* affects elements like scrollbars, form inputs, and other browser supported UI elements. As of
* Bootstrap 5.3 this is automatic (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/color-modes/#enable-dark-mode)
* though the suggested method of setting the theme is via data-bs-theme attributes instead of which CSS file to load.
