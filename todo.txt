Top cards and Search cards pages:
	total picks + cubes empty
	sort by elo not working correctly
	global elo not being decremented
	typing in should have submit button instead of live 
		quick filter options for color and MV don't work
Socials tab broken
have usernames pre-loaded everywhere
have cube images pre-loaded everywhere
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
draft can hang
http://localhost:8080/cube/overview/9f
	does not load analytics

Investigate
	- is indexing of cubes correct after updates? does the most recently cube get put at top of list?
	- Make sure feed works as intended
	- new session, login from landing seems to not work then redirect to landing with no error?

Eventually
redo draftbots into something more basic
