password recovery might not be working
draft can hang
Capitalization issues on front end
analytics script resets elo to 1200 instead of loading previous state
login/logout not consistently working
upload bulk with issues page broken

Investigate
	- is indexing of cubes correct after updates? does the most recently cube get put at top of list?
	- Make sure feed works as intended
	- new session, login from landing seems to not work then redirect to landing with no error?
	- don't update cube hashes for followers changes or deck count changes. have this be picked up by sweeper

Eventually
redo draftbots into something more basic
have usernames pre-loaded everywhere
have cube images pre-loaded everywhere
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
add timestamp (not just date) to history tab
quickly switching cards between deck and sideboard during a sealed playtest, a few cards got duplicated
batch get and batch put use cache!!
