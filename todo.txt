Investigate
	- is indexing of cubes correct after updates? does the most recently cube get put at top of list?
	- Make sure feed works as intended
	- new session, login from landing seems to not work then redirect to landing with no error?

Eventually
redo draftbots into something more basic
have usernames pre-loaded everywhere
have cube images pre-loaded everywhere
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
add timestamp (not just date) to history tab
