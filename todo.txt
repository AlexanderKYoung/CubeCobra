card packages don't load correctly
I am no longer getting any notifications
and the "your cubes" list on the main dashboard is no longer sorted by last edited/updated date

apostrophies don't work for autocard markdown
anchors on the overview pages broken? They don't seem to go to take you to any particular spot on the page
in multiplayer drafts, the non host seats look like bots
can't filter recommendations by maybeboard anymore
legality=modern shouldn't include cards banned in modern
accepting content creator application times out

remigrate patron levels, as a lot are -1 for some reason	
cubes with no basics crash deckbuilder
tags not autocompleting
I am unable to update my email address for my Cube Cobra account from the account information page.
After entering the new email and confirming password, the page hangs for a minute and then times out with a 504 Gateway Time-out.
add premodern as cube type overrid=9+-+0 
remove comment from notice broken

after multiplayer draft, non-host seats error

Investigate

quickly switching cards between deck and sideboard during a sealed playtest, a few cards got duplicated
don't display mainboard header in changelist/changelog if only mainboard was changed
tag colors don't display in list view
don't update cube hashes for followers changes or deck count changes. have this be picked up by sweeper
drafts freezing is b/c they are getting stuck in "done" state by mistake, possible that we're not checking this in a consistent way?
capitalize board names in cube, including board drop down select
when adding through add to cube modal, put in pending changes instead of updating DB
Filter doesn't work on Tokens page
filtering on recommended cards does not seem to work anymore
filtercollapse should require a submit button again
