Cannot set tag colors
Hitting Save on edit settings in cube overview seems to spin forever, with or without settings changes
Opening a card that had edits applied still shows Pending Edit until page refresh
cube search should strip non-alphanumeric character
quickly switching cards between deck and sideboard during a sealed playtest, a few cards got duplicated
draft deck names are nonsense
draft seat labels are nonsense
draftbots always pick first card in pack
password recovery might not be working
draft can hang
Capitalization issues on front end
analytics script resets elo to 1200 instead of loading previous state


Investigate
	- is indexing of cubes correct after updates? does the most recently cube get put at top of list?
	- Make sure feed works as intended
	- new session, login from landing seems to not work then redirect to landing with no error?

Eventually
redo draftbots into something more basic
have usernames pre-loaded everywhere
have cube images pre-loaded everywhere
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
add timestamp (not just date) to history tab
