drafts not visible under playtest tab
"not a valid cube category override" when editing cube overview
draftbots always pick first card in pack
elo graph drops to 1200 when datapoint is empty
card page play rate % is wrong
top cards and search cards filtertext is wrong, says `Filtered 0 cards to 0`
draft can hang
the URL for the confirmation email is always https://cubecobra.com/user/register/confirm/undefined
editing or cloning a saved draft deck causes an error
Capitalization issues on front end
"Create Blog Post" checkbox is ignored, treated as always checked
Cannot set tag colors
Cannot set profile pic (cardname for image box can't be typed in)
Hitting Save on edit settings in cube overview seems to spin forever, with or without settings changes
Opening a card that had edits applied still shows Pending Edit until page refresh
cube search should strip non-alphanumeric character

Investigate
	- is indexing of cubes correct after updates? does the most recently cube get put at top of list?
	- Make sure feed works as intended
	- new session, login from landing seems to not work then redirect to landing with no error?

Eventually
redo draftbots into something more basic
have usernames pre-loaded everywhere
have cube images pre-loaded everywhere
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
add timestamp (not just date) to history tab
