Cards Packages page doesn't load
Top cards and Search cards pages:
	don't have elo
	mouse over doesn't work
	typing in should have submit button instead of live 
		quick filter optionms for color and MV don't work
Socials tab broken
have usernames pre-loaded everywhere
have cube images pre-loaded everywhere
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
cube elo and pick rate / pick count not propogated
draft can hang

Investigate
	- is indexing of cubes correct after updates? does the most recently cube get put at top of list?
	- Make sure feed works as intended
	- new session, login from landing seems to not work then redirect to landing with no error?

Eventually
redo draftbots into something more basic
