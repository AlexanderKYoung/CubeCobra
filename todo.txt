im getting this wierd error when i type "sync" into the "card to add" field. adding other cards works fine its just typing the word "sync" causes an error
When I try a grid draft with 2 player local, it still does a bot draft.
add limit to recent drafts of your cube on dashboard
remove comment from notice broken
admin dashboard -> featured cubes queue
"Phyrexia: All Will Be One Cube Update"
card packages don't load correctly
I am no longer getting any notifications
and the "your cubes" list on the main dashboard is no longer sorted by last edited/updated date
it just seems locked in whatever order it happened to be in before the last update
apostrophies don't work for autocard markdown
anchors on the overview pages broken? They don't seem to go to take you to any particular spot on the page
in multiplayer drafts, the non host seats look like bots
can't filter recommendations by maybeboard anymore
legality=modern shouldn't include cards banned in modern
accepting content creator application times out
I have a cube with multiples of cards, and I can now only change out one at a time. When I try and swap them all at the same time, only one gets updated
remigrate patron levels, as a lot are -1 for some reason	
add battle as type

after multiplayer draft, non-host seats error
seat names should include player name or bot instead of just the deck color

Investigate
	- validate patreon integration
	- validate featured cube rotation

Eventually
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
quickly switching cards between deck and sideboard during a sealed playtest, a few cards got duplicated
don't display mainboard header in changelist/changelog if only mainboard was changed
tag colors don't display in list view
don't update cube hashes for followers changes or deck count changes. have this be picked up by sweeper
drafts freezing is b/c they are getting stuck in "done" state by mistake, possible that we're not checking this in a consistent way?
capitalize board names in cube, including board drop down select
when adding through add to cube modal, put in pending changes instead of updating DB
Filter doesn't work on Tokens page
filtering on recommended cards does not seem to work anymore
filtercollapse should require a submit button again
look into failed deck migrations and get those moved over too


multiplayer drafting

	Got stuck, picks were piling up on seat 7 and bot picks were not being made
	after refresh, things were working normally and draft finished
