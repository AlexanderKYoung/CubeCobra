Migration related
cube
	custom draft formats not migrated
deck
	decks are saved as strings instead of json
	put errored doc ids in a file, investigate separetely. There's too many for just spillage

Investigate
	- validate patreon integration
	- validate featured cube rotation

Eventually
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
quickly switching cards between deck and sideboard during a sealed playtest, a few cards got duplicated
don't display mainboard header in changelist/changelog if only mainboard was changed
tag colors don't display in list view
don't update cube hashes for followers changes or deck count changes. have this be picked up by sweeper
drafts freezing is b/c they are getting stuck in "done" state by mistake, possible that we're not checking this in a consistent way?
capitalize board names in cube, including board drop down select
when adding through add to cube modal, put in pending changes instead of updating DB
