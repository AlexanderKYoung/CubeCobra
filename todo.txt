draft lobby needs hydrated users

Investigate
	- validate patreon integration
	- validate featured cube rotation

Eventually
have usernames pre-loaded everywhere
have cube images pre-loaded everywhere
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
quickly switching cards between deck and sideboard during a sealed playtest, a few cards got duplicated
batch get and batch put use cache!!
don't display mainboard header in changelist/changelog if only mainboard was changed
tag colors don't display in list view
don't update cube hashes for followers changes or deck count changes. have this be picked up by sweeper
drafts freezing is b/c they are getting stuck in "done" state by mistake, possible that we're not checking this in a consistent way?
Capitalization issues on front end
capitalize board names in cube, including board drop down select
