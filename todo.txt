cube analysis page broken
don't display mainboard header in changelist/changelog if only mainboard was changed
tag colors don't display in list view
Capitalization issues on front end
blog post is created regardless of whether or not the checkbox is checked
login/logout not consistently working
markdown broken


Investigate
	- drafts freezing is b/c they are getting stuck in "done" state by mistake, possible that we're not checking this in a consistent way?
	- is indexing of cubes correct after updates? does the most recently cube get put at top of list?
	- Make sure feed works as intended
	- new session, login from landing seems to not work then redirect to landing with no error?
	- don't update cube hashes for followers changes or deck count changes. have this be picked up by sweeper

Eventually
have usernames pre-loaded everywhere
have cube images pre-loaded everywhere
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
quickly switching cards between deck and sideboard during a sealed playtest, a few cards got duplicated
batch get and batch put use cache!!


Important
Have better way to get ip list for cache
