Top cards and Search cards pages:
	typing in should have submit button instead of live 
	quick filter options for color and MV don't work
Socials tab broken
have usernames pre-loaded everywhere
have cube images pre-loaded everywhere
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
draft can hang
does not load analytics: http://localhost:8080/cube/overview/9f
cube 404s: http://localhost:8080/cube/overview/3t0

Investigate
	- is indexing of cubes correct after updates? does the most recently cube get put at top of list?
	- Make sure feed works as intended
	- new session, login from landing seems to not work then redirect to landing with no error?

Eventually
redo draftbots into something more basic
